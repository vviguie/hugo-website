# Adaptation to natural disasters (floods, hurricanes etc.)

<!--more-->
In this lecture, we cover the second type of direct impacts : natural disasters. Climate change can induce natural disasters in a number of ways : hurricanes, river floods, coastal floods, landslides, wildfires etc.

Adaptation to these impacts imposes changes in the way traditional natural risk prevention is done. this is especially due to the progressive nature of climate change, and to the quantitative uncertainties surrounding the exact magnitude of its impacts.

## Required reading

### To know more
- An article by Carbon Brief about [what the 2021 IPCC report says about extreme weather and climate change](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-about-extreme-weather-and-climate-change)
- The [articles on the effects of climate change, on NASA website](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/)
- a [2021 UN report](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/weather-related-disasters-increase-over-past-50-years-causing-more-damage-fewer) about the increase in weather-related disasters since 50 years.
- On storm surges you can see :

- As a note: Hurricane Sandy, in 2012, caused destructions in New York City mainly due to its *storm surge* (local sea level rise during the hurricane, making the sea go inland and cause floods). Hurricane Ida, in 2021, caused destructions mainly due to its intense rainfall that overwhelmed the sewers, leading to *pluvial flooding*. Adaptation policies to both phenomena are different. See for instance [here](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/03/1034315/ida-dodged-nyc-flood-defenses-climate-change-storm/) for an analysis.
