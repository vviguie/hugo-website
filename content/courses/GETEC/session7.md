# Urban form and land planning

<!--more-->

In this lecture, we discuss an important part of urban policies: land planning. Land planning plays a key role to get adapted to climate change impacts, but also to reduce emissions, and to mitigate  losses in ecosystem services. It also plays a key role on social and economic issues. How can we conciliate all these questions? Are there synergies and trade-offs?
