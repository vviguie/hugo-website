# Buildings and residential energy consumption (heating, cooling etc.)

<!--more-->

In this lecture, we cover the second part of emissions in cities: residential emissions. They include emissions caused by heating, cooling, cooking and by all electrical appliances at home. Many policies are implemented at the state and local levels to reduce these emissions, but such policies are not easy to design.
