# Health issues and heat waves

<!--more-->
In this lecture, we cover a first type of direct impacts : 
- The impacts on freshwater availability
- The increase in heat wave risk

Adaptation to these impacts are important elements of adaptation strategies of numerous cities around the world. 

## Required reading

[Why avoiding climate change ‘maladaptation’ is vital](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-why-avoiding-climate-change-maladaptation-is-vital/) (2021).

## Freshwater availability
