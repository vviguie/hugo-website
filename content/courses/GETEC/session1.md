- The [EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases) provides a nice introduction to what is climate change and what are greenhouse gases.
- The [WRI website](https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/02/greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-country-sector) and its [Climate Watch](https://www.wri.org/initiatives/climate-watch) platform, provides clear explanations about where the emissions come from, and the link with economic activity.
