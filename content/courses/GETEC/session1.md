# Introduction to climate change and greenhouse gases emissions

<!--more-->

In this lecture, we quickly cover the basics of the greenhouse effect and of climate change. It is an introductory lesson meant to be sure that these notions are correctly understood, as they are important to understand the issues around urban climate policies.

## What is climate change, and what are the greenhouse gases?

## To know more

- The [Global Carbon project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/products/internetResources.htm#General) references many internet resources on climate change and emissions.
- The [EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases) provides a nice introduction to what is climate change and what are greenhouse gases.
- The [WRI website](https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/02/greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-country-sector) and its [Climate Watch](https://www.wri.org/initiatives/climate-watch) platform, provides clear explanations about where the emissions come from, and the link with economic activity.
- [MIT](https://climate.mit.edu/) and [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/) websites on climate change provide clear introductory articles and great infographics. So does [Imperial College website](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/)
- [Map of observed temperature changes everywhere in the world](https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-every-part-of-the-world-has-warmed-and-could-continue-to-warm) on carbonbrief.org.
- The [Interactive atlas of the last IPCC report](https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/)
- Climate Action Tracker (https://climateactiontracker.org/)
Here are a few ideas of websites with basic information on climate change (many other exist) :
- [Our World in data](https://ourworldindata.org/) to get key figures on climate change.
