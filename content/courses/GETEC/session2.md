## Case study group 1 : Cape Town water crisis

Present, in less than 20 min, the Cape Town water crisis (mid-2017 to mid-2018).

Explain what happened, which policies were implemented during the crisis, and which longer-terme policies were (or not) implemented to prevent such a crisis to happen again.

So far, what were apparently the longer term consequences of this crisis? Did it create tensions or diminish them ?
Could such a crisis happen in Europe, and could the policies/issues be transposed to European cities?
