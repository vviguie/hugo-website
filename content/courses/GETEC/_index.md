## Objective of the course

It is far from trivial for urban decision-makers to account for climate concerns in their decisions. First, the effectiveness of potential urban environmental policies is difficult to assess. The ways urban policies may impact GHG emissions or our vulnerability to climate change are numerous and complex. Various urban policies may interact, leading to synergies or trade-offs which are not always clearly understood. Second, climate action does not happen in a vacuum, but in a political context with pre-existing issues, social tensions, and policy objectives. The main objective of this course is therefore double: 
- To understand the main challenges that metropolitan regions are facing in relation to climate change
- How to critically assess the potential responses to these challenges. 


## Program overview

There are 12 sessions, grouped into 4 themes:
-	Climate change impacts on cities (3 sessions)
-	Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in cities (3 sessions)
-	Implementing climate policies (3 sessions)
-	Cross-cutting issues (3 sessions)

## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
A good understanding of the physical mechanisms behind climate change, the origin of greenhouse gases emissions, and the main consequences of climate changes, is required.

Here are a few ideas of websites with basic information on climate change (many other exist):
- [MIT](https://climate.mit.edu/) and [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/) websites on climate change provide clear introductory articles and great infographics. So does [Imperial College website](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/)
- [NY Times FAQ on climate change](https://www.nytimes.com/article/climate-change-global-warming-faq.html) and the [plain language definition of Climate Jargon](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/10/31/climate/climate-change-sustainability-definition.html?action=click)
- [A nice document by IPCC explaining how to teach climate change](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/ST1.5_OCE_LR.pdf), really worth reading
- [in French] https://bonpote.com/les-meilleures-sources-sur-lenvironnement-et-le-climat-tous-niveaux-confondus/

If you are in France, it is worth trying to participate to a [Fresque du climat](https://fresqueduclimat.org/) event. It is also worth watching this [introductory lecture by Valérie Masson Delmotte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSPb5o7oZIU) to the convention citoyenne du climat [in French].

## Self-assessment quiz
To know your knowledge level on climate change.

It is recommended that you know what to answer to the following questions, to take the most of the course.
{{< spoiler text="Click to unroll the questions" >}}
-	Could you explain simply what is the greenhouse effect and what is climate change ?
-	What are the main greenhouse gases, and how are they produced by human activities?
-	Why do we say that red meat consumption is an important cause of greenhouse gases emissions?
-	If we stopped all GHG emissions now, how long would it take for the climate to come back to normal?
-	What is the link between climate change and ozone layer?
-	What is the link between climate change and air pollution?
-	What is the link between climate change and global biodiverse decrease?
-	What will be the main impacts of climate change in a city like Paris?
-	What will be the main impacts of climate change in a city like Madrid?
-	What will be the main impacts of climate change in a city like New York?
