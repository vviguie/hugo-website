## Objective of the course

It is far from trivial for urban decision-makers to account for climate concerns in their decisions. First, the effectiveness of potential urban environmental policies is difficult to assess. The ways urban policies may impact GHG emissions or our vulnerability to climate change are numerous and complex. Various urban policies may interact, leading to synergies or trade-offs which are not always clearly understood. Second, climate action does not happen in a vacuum, but in a political context with pre-existing issues, social tensions, and policy objectives. The main objective of this course is therefore double: 
- To understand the main challenges that metropolitan regions are facing in relation to climate change
- How to critically assess the potential responses to these challenges. 


## Program overview

There are 12 sessions, grouped into 4 themes:
-	Climate change impacts on cities (3 sessions)
-	Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in cities (3 sessions)
-	Implementing climate policies (3 sessions)
-	Cross-cutting issues (3 sessions)

- [C40 knowledge hub](https://www.c40knowledgehub.org) *"Cutting-edge insights and practical resources from leading climate cities."* This website provides synthetic reports about main climate-related issues in cities, as well as numerous examples of adaptation and mitigation policies implemented in cities around the world. 
- [Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org) provides clear articles about the latest research on climate change and climate policies. Their newsletter is a must-read for anyone interested by climate change.

## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
A good understanding of the physical mechanisms behind climate change, the origin of greenhouse gases emissions, and the main consequences of climate changes, is required.

Here are a few ideas of websites with basic information on climate change (many other exist) :
- [MIT](https://climate.mit.edu/) and [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/) websites on climate change provide clear introductory articles and great infographics. So does [Imperial College website](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/)
- [NY Times FAQ on climate change](https://www.nytimes.com/article/climate-change-global-warming-faq.html)
- [A nice document by IPCC explaining how to teach climate change](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/ST1.5_OCE_LR.pdf), really worth reading]
- [in French] https://bonpote.com/les-meilleures-sources-sur-lenvironnement-et-le-climat-tous-niveaux-confondus/

If you are in France, it is worth trying to participate to a [Fresque du climat](https://fresqueduclimat.org/) event. It is also worth watching this [introductory lecture by Valérie Masson Delmotte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSPb5o7oZIU) to the convention citoyenne du climat [in French].
