# Summary
The aim of the Summer School is to foster scientific exchanges between participants and faculty members about human and policy dimensions of urban sustainability, and the modelling methods relevant to address the different dimensions to this broad issue.

The topic covered retrospective (e.g. econometrics) and prospective (e.g. using integrated models) studies on all dimensions of urban sustainability: GHG emissions, adaptation to climate change, air pollution, ecosystem services. The studies analyzed either costs, benefits, or equity issues related to these concepts, while being relevant for policy making, for instance.

- What are the costs of urban climate change mitigation and/or adaptation policies?
- What are their co-benefits?
- What are their short and medium term distributional impacts ?

Those are some of the questions that were raised during the Summer School, which gathered students working with quantitative approaches (retrospective, e.g. econometrics, or prospective, e.g. using integrated models) to address the different dimensions of this topic.

The lectures given by the School’s faculty members provided the background scientific material. Participants were asked to present a version of their research work to receive feedback from fellow students and from the School’s faculty members. Additional activities included group project exercises, conferences and social events. The faculty was composed of researchers from CIRED, Climate Change Center Berlin Brandenburg, and international leaders in environmental economics and integrated assessment modelling.
