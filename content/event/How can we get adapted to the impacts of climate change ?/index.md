summary:
abstract: Climate change can have major impacts on the economy and the society, especially if we do not achieve carbon neutrality quickly. Beyond the projections of climate models, what can these impacts mean in concrete terms on our daily lives ? How can we prepare for these changes? During this presentation, I propose to present the main elements of answers to these questions in the academic literature. This subject (what is called "adaptation to climate change") is a very active research topic. Policies to prepare for the impacts of climate change are also beginning to develop throughout France and around the world, and may play a fundamental role in reducing our future vulnerability.
