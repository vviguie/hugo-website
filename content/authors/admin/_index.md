I am a researcher in environmental economics. I work on climate change impacts and urban policies.

I am a researcher in climate change economics at [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/), in the  [Centre International de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement, (CIRED)](www.centre-cired.fr).  

My research and writing explore environmental urban policies, and especially adaptation strategies to reduce our vulnerability to climate change impacts in cities. I have a strong interest in prospective modelling, and in understanding how various environmental concerns interact with each other, and with social issues. 

I teach courses climate change and adaptation policies in [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/), [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-urbaine/fr/governing-ecological-transitions-european-cities.html), and [Ecole Nationale de la Météorologie](http://www.enm-toulouse.fr/).

## Interests
- Climate change adaptation economics : Evaluation of climate policies, Climate change impacts and vulnerabilities, natural disasters indirect economic impacts
- Sustainable city development : Climate Policy implications on/from urban areas, Synergies and conflicts between urban climate policies and other urban policies
- Modelling and methodologies : Modelling of coupled human/natural/engineering systems, Urban structure dynamics (Land-use transport interaction models), future studies and long-term scenarios
