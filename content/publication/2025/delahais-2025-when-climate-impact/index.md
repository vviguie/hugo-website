abstract: 'Climate change is expected to cause increasingly severe economic and social
  disruptions, making adaptation a key pillar of climate policy. Assessing the economic
  costs of climate impacts is essential to inform adaptation strategies, especially
  when these costs are used to calibrate the scale of adaptation investments and to
  weigh adaptation needs against other policy priorities. Yet, estimates of these
  costs vary widely across studies. Here we compare the estimated economic cost of
  climate change for France across two lines of evidence: international macroeconomic
  studies and national policy documents. We find that recent macroeconomic literature,
  especially econometric studies, produces much higher cost estimates than those that
  can be inferred from aggregating national policy assessments. This discrepancy can
  be attributed to methodological lag, limited sectoral coverage, lack of monetization,
  and the omission of cross-border effects. Besides, we also show that while the national
  institutional literature is extensive, many broad impact categories lack comprehensive
  quantification, and even fewer are monetized.'
