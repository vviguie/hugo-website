abstract: With Charlotte Liotta and Felix Creutzig, we studied 120 cities across all continents except Africa (due to a lack of available data) and found that, in each of these cities, it is possible to combine reduction of GHG emissions and the enhancement of quality of life, through well-adapted policy choices.
