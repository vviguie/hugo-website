abstract: 'Achieving sustainable urban transportation is critical, and local policies are crucial in achieving this goal. In a recent study published in Nature Sustainability, we find that city-specific strategies can effectively reduce emissions while improving the well-being of urban dwellers. Our study reveals that it is possible to identify climate protection policies that scale in a large number of cities while nonetheless respecting their differences. This is a milestone in the field of urban climate science.'
