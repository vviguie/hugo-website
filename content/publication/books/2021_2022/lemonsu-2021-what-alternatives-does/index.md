abstract: 'This volume demonstrates how urban climate science can provide valuable
  information for planning healthy cities. The book illustrates the idea of \"Science
  in Time, Science in Place\" by providing worldwide case-based urban climatic planning
  applications for a variety of regions and countries, utilizing relevant climatic-spatial
  planning experiences to address local climatic and environmental health issues.
  Comprised of three major sections entitled \"The Rise of Mega-cities and the Concept
  of Climate Resilience and Healthy Living,\" \"Urban Climate Science in Action,\"
  and \"Future Challenges and the Way Forward,\" the book argues for the recognition
  of climate as a key element of healthy cities. Topics covered include: urban resilience
  in a climate context, climate responsive planning and urban climate interventions
  to achieve healthy cities, climate extremes, public health impact, urban climate-related
  health risk information, urban design and planning, and governance and management
  of sustainable urban development. The book will appeal to an international audience
  of practicing planners and designers, public health and built environment professionals,
  social scientists, researchers in epidemiology, climatology and biometeorology,
  and international to city scale policy makers.'
