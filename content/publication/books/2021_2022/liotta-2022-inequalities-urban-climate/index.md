abstract: Existing research on the equity impact of climate policies tends to focus
  on inequalities across income levels and neglect inequalities between households
  living in different locations. This column analyses how a simple fuel tax might
  impact households in Cape Town, South Africa of different levels of income, but
  also living in different types of housing and locations within the city. Low-income
  households and households living in the periphery are most affected by the tax in
  the short term, but are more likely to adapt in the medium run by switching transportation
  modes and employment centres. However, the authors find persisting inequalities
  generated by the fuel tax in the long run.
