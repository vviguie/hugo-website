abstract: 'An introduction to the challenges facing urban areas and the urgent
  need to make them more sustainable:
  - A key challenge is the complexity of cities that leads to non-linear and unintended consequences of, often well meant, interventions.
  - Underlines the case for a more integrated response to deliver more sustainable
  urban areas, and the need for a new generation of integrated assessment methods
  and tools to operationalise this.  
  - Introduces the structure of the rest of the
  book.'
