abstract: 'City-level policies are increasingly recognized as key components of strategies
  to reduce transport greenhouse gas emissions. However, at a global scale, their
  total efficiencies, costs and practical feasibility remain unclear. Here we use
  a spatially explicit monocentric urban economic model, systematically calibrated
  on 120 cities worldwide, to analyse the impact of four representative policies aimed
  at mitigating transportation greenhouse gas emissions, also accounting for their
  economic welfare impacts and health co-benefits. Applying these policies in all
  cities, we find that total transportation greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced
  by 31% in 15 years, compared with the baseline scenario. However, the consequences
  of the same policies vary widely between cities, with specific effects depending
  on the policy considered, income level, population growth rate, spatial organization
  and existing public transport supply. Impacts on transport emissions span from high
  to almost zero, and consequences in terms of welfare can either be positive or negative.
  Applying welfare-increasing policy portfolios captures most of the emission reductions:
  overall, they reduce emissions by 22% in 15 years. Our results highlight that there
  is no one-size-fits-all policy. However, with context-specific strategies, large
  emission reductions can globally be achieved while improving welfare.'
