abstract: " Understanding the cooling service provided by vegetation in cities is important
  to inform urban policy and planning. However, the performance of decision-support
  tools estimating heat mitigation for urban greening strategies is not systematically
  evaluated. Here, we develop a calibration algorithm and evaluate the performance
  of the Urban Cooling model developed within the open-source InVEST (Integrated Valuation
  of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) software. The Urban Cooling model estimates
  air temperature reduction due to vegetation based on four predictors: shade provision,
  evapotranspiration, albedo, and building density and was designed for data-rich
  and data-scarce situations. We apply the calibration algorithm and evaluate the
  model in two case studies (Paris, France, and Minneapolis-St Paul, USA) by examining
  the spatial correlation between InVEST predictions and reference temperature data
  at 1-km horizontal resolution. In both case studies, model performance was high
  for nighttime air temperatures, which is an important indicator of human wellbeing.
  After calibration, we found a medium performance for surface temperatures during
  daytime but a low performance for daytime air temperatures in both case studies,
  which may be due to model and data limitations. We illustrate the model adequacy
  for urban planning by testing its ability to simulate a green infrastructure scenario
  in the Paris case study. The predicted air temperature change compared well with
  that of an alternative physics-based model (rtextsuperscript2=0.55 and rtextsuperscript2=0.85,
  for air daytime and nighttime temperatures, respectively). Finally, we discuss opportunities
  and challenges for the use of such parsimonious decision-support tools, highlighting
  their importance to mainstream ecosystem services information in urban planning."
