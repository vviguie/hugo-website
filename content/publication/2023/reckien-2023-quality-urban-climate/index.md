abstract: Defining and measuring progress in adaptation are important questions for
  climate adaptation science, policy, and practice. Here, we assess the progress of
  urban adaptation planning in 327 European cities between 2005 and 2020 using three
  *ADAptation plan Quality Assessment* indices, called ADAQA-1/ 2/ 3, that combine
  six plan quality principles. Half of the cities have an adaptation plan and its
  quality significantly increased over time. However, generally, plan quality is still
  low in many cities. Participation and monitoring and evaluation are particularly
  weak aspects in urban adaptation policy, together with plan `consistency'. Consistency
  connects impacts and vulnerabilities with adaptation goals, planned measures, actions,
  monitoring and evaluation, and participation processes. Consistency is a key factor
  in the overall quality of plans. To help evaluate the quality of plans and policies
  and promote learning, we suggest incorporating our ADAptation plan Quality Assessment
  indices into the portfolio of adaptation progress assessments and tracking methodologies.
