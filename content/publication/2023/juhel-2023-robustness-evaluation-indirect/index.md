abstract: Given the interconnectedness of economies and the prevalence of just-in-time
  production processes, even small interruptions to production caused by natural disasters
  can lead to great indirect economic impacts. A substantial body of literature on
  this subject exists, notably with the help of input-output analysis, CGE and agent-based
  models. However, such models rely on parameters and data which are often unobserved
  empirically or estimated with wide margins of uncertainty. The reliability of these
  models is therefore difficult to assess. Here, taking the example of the July 2021
  floods in Germany, we analyze to what extent the results of the ARIO model are robust
  to input data and parameter choices. The ARIO model is a widely used model in the
  literature, and has laid theoretical foundations for several other models. We conduct
  a sensitivity analysis by varying its key parameters, as well as the multi-regional
  input output tables which it uses as its main input data. For this, we develop a
  new resource-efficient Python implementation of the ARIO model, which enables a
  large number of simulations to be run. Our results show that the choice of the data
  source and parameters indeed heavily influences the outputs of the model. To ensure
  the robustness of their results, future studies on indirect economic impacts should
  incorporate several scenarios and employ data from various sources.
