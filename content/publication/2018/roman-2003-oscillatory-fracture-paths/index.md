abstract: "We report a novel mode of quasi-static oscillatory crack propagation when
   a cutting tip of moderately large width is driven through a thin brittle polymer
   film. Experiments show that the amplitude and wavelength of the oscillatory crack
   paths scale linearly with the width of the cutting tip over a wide range of length
   scales but are independent of the width of the sheet and of the cutting speed.
   We propose a mechanism for this instability, based on the coupling between crack
   propagation and out-of-plane deformations of the film."
