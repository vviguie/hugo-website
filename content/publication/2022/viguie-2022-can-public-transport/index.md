abstract: "It is difficult to cut transport greenhouse gas emissions without affecting\
  \ negatively the poorest people. A solution, in cities, is to target low income\
  \ districts with public transport investments. However, after a few years, changes\
  \ in neighborhoods, especially transit-induced gentrification, may prevent the social\
  \ objective to be met. Whether public transport actually leads to population displacement\
  \ has been extensively studied empirically, but the literature is inconclusive:\
  \ the longer-term impact of such investments remains unclear. Here, we study the\
  \ evolution of job accessibility in Paris metropolitan area between 1968 and 2010,\
  \ by income and labor group, following the changes in the transport network. We\
  \ show that major public transport lines, when they were built, served the needs\
  \ of all groups in an almost neutral way. However, a few years later, due to population\
  \ and job movements, actual changes in accessibility systematically resulted in\
  \ gains for richer households and losses for poorer ones. Such a pattern is consistently\
  \ observed in every decade between 1968 and 2010. It appears to be due primarily\
  \ to unequal changes in the numbers of jobs in each labor group, and secondly to\
  \ the changes in both job locations and in inhabitants' residences. To maintain\
  \ job accessibility to poorest inhabitants over time, beyond improving transport\
  \ network, trying to maintain -or to move in a planned way- the location of their\
  \ jobs and residence appears as a key variable."
