 abstract = {In this work, we present a gridded dataset about land cover, population density, real estate, and transportation in 192 worldwide urban areas representing together 800 million people. While population density and land cover are secondary data extracted from the GHS-POP and the ESA CCI databases respectively, transportation and real estate data are primary data obtained from the Google Maps API and the web scrapping of real estate websites. For each city of the sample, these data are aggregated on a 1km resolution grid, allowing an integrated analysis with applications including for instance urban sprawl analysis. This dataset is the first dataset including spatialized data on real estate and transportation in a large sample of cities covering both developed and developing countries.},
