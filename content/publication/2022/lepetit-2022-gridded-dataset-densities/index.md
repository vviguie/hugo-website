abstract: In this work, we present a gridded dataset about land cover, population
  density, real estate, and transportation in 192 worldwide urban areas representing
  together 800 million people. While population density and land cover are secondary
  data extracted from the GHS-POP and the ESA CCI databases respectively, transportation
  and real estate data are primary data obtained from the Google Maps API and the
  web scrapping of real estate websites. For each city of the sample, these data are
  aggregated on a 1km resolution grid, allowing an integrated analysis with applications
  including for instance urban sprawl analysis. This dataset is the first dataset
  including spatialized data on real estate and transportation in a large sample of
  cities covering both developed and developing countries.
