abstract: 'City-level policies are increasingly recognized as key components of strategies
  to reduce transport greenhouse gas emissions. However, at a global scale, their
  total efficiencies, costs, and practical feasibility remain unclear. Here, we use
  a spatially-explicit urban economic model, systematically calibrated on 120 cities
  worldwide, to analyze the impact of four representative policies aiming at mitigating
  transportation GHG emissions, also accounting for their economic welfare impacts
  and health co-benefits. Applying these policies in all cities, we find that total
  transportation GHG emissions can be reduced by 28% in 15 years, compared with the
  baseline scenario. However, the consequences of the same policies vary widely between
  cities, with specific effects depending on the policy considered, income level,
  population growth rate, spatial organization, and existing public transport supply.
  Impacts on transport emissions span from high to almost zero, and consequences in
  terms of welfare can either be positive or negative. Applying only welfare-increasing
  policies captures most of the emission reductions: overall, they reduce emissions
  by 20% in 15 years. Our results highlight that there is no one-size-fits-all optimal
  policy to mitigate urban transport emissions but that cities can match their specific
  situation with a selection of mitigation policies: hence, we call for global climate
  mitigation models to better represent heterogeneity across cities.'
