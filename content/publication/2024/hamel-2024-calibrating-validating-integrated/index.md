abstract: Understanding the cooling service provided by vegetation in cities is important
  to inform urban policy and planning. However, the performance of decision-support
  tools estimating heat mitigation for urban greening strategies has not been evaluated
  systematically. Here, we further develop a calibration algorithm and evaluate the
  performance of the urban cooling model developed within the open-source InVEST (Integrated
  Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) software. The urban cooling model
  estimates air temperature reduction due to vegetation based on four predictors,
  shade, evapotranspiration, albedo, and building density, and was designed for data-rich
  and data-scarce situations. We apply the calibration algorithm and evaluate the
  model in two case studies (Paris, France, and Minneapolis--St Paul, USA) by examining
  the spatial correlation between InVEST predictions and reference temperature data
  at a 1 km horizontal resolution. In both case studies, model performance was high
  for nighttime air temperatures, which are an important indicator of human wellbeing.
  After calibration, we found medium performance for surface temperatures during daytime
  but low performance for daytime air temperatures in both case studies, which may
  be due to model and data limitations. We illustrate the model adequacy for urban
  planning by testing its ability to simulate a green infrastructure scenario in the
  Paris case study. The predicted air temperature change compared well to that of
  an alternative physics-based model (r2=0.55 and r2=0.85 for daytime and nighttime
  air temperatures, respectively). Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges
  for the use of such parsimonious decision-support tools, highlighting their importance
  to mainstream ecosystem services information for urban planning.
