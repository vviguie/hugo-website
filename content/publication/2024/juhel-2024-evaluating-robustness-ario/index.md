abstract: Given the interconnectedness of modern economies and the widespread adoption
  of just-in-time production methods, even minor disruptions caused by natural disasters
  can lead to substantial indirect economic impact. A substantial body of literature
  has explored this phenomenon, using input-output analysis, computable general equilibrium
  and agent-based models. However, these models (i) heavily rely on parameters and
  data that often lack empirical grounding or (ii) exhibit considerable uncertainty,
  making it challenging to assess their reliability. The ARIO model has been widely
  used in the literature and has provided theoretical foundation for several related
  models. Using the July 2021 floods in Germany as a case study, we assess the sensitivity
  of the results of this model by varying key parameters, as well as the multi-regional
  input-output tables (MRIOTs), which constitute its primary input data. To facilitate
  this analysis, we introduce a new, resource-efficient Python implementation of the
  ARIO model, enabling the execution of a large number of simulations. Our findings
  highlight the substantial impact of data source and parameter selection on model
  outcomes, especially so when post-disaster rebuilding is costly. To ensure the robustness
  of their results, future studies on indirect economic impacts should be careful
  about recovery dynamics, consider multiple scenarios and compare results using MRIOTs
  from various sources.
