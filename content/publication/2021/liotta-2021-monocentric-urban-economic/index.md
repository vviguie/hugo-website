abstract: 'Despite a large body of work that developed over more than 60 years, and
  numerous applications in theoretical papers, the empirical knowledge accumulated
  on the monocentric urban model and its extensions remains limited. Using a unique
  dataset gathering spatially explicit data on rents, population densities, housing
  sizes, and transport times in neighborhoods inside 192 cities on all continents,
  we investigate on a systematic basis the empirical relevance of the key stylized
  facts predicted by this model. Some of these predictions appear extremely robust:
  cities are more spread out when they are richer, more populated, and when transportation
  or agricultural land is less costly, and 95% of the cities of our sample exhibit
  the predicted negative density gradient from the city center to suburbs. Rent variations
  inside cities are also significantly explained by transport times in most of the
  cities (159 cities). However, housing production (and population densities) seem
  significantly impacted by rents in only slightly more than half of the cities (106
  cities). Nevertheless, high levels of informality, strong regulations and planning,
  specific amenities (e.g. coastal amenities) are, as expected by the theory, main
  factors leading to the discrepancies. Overall, several decades after its creation,
  the standard urban model seems to still capture surprisingly well the inner structure
  of many cities across the world, both in developed and in developing countries.'
