abstract: Urban sprawl impacts are critical in the evaluation of planning decisions
  and often monitored by indicators of soil sealing. In France, these indicators are
  required by law to be reported in environmental assessments of planning documents.
  Although monitoring of soil sealing is important to limit environmental impacts,
  focusing on this sole dimension in urban planning can be reductive. In this paper,
  we explore to what extent ecosystem services (ES) indicators, measuring the benefits
  to humans provided by healthy ecosystems, are captured by soil sealing indicators
  by comparing their temporal and spatial evolutions. Through consulting with urban
  planning stakeholders, we model and map the spatial and temporal evolutions over
  a 35-year period of soil sealing and eight priority ES in the Paris metropolitan
  area (agricultural potential, groundwater recharge, global climate regulation, water
  quality regulation through nutrient retention, urban heat mitigation, flood mitigation,
  recreational potential and natural heritage). We highlight the spatial and temporal
  matches and mismatches between the two types of indicators (ES and soil sealing)
  and demonstrate that a large part of ES variations in time and space are not well
  captured by soil sealing indicators (spatial match with the eight ES is only found
  for 10% of the Paris metropolitan area). This calls for finer, ES-based, diagnosis
  in land use planning that could usefully illuminate the gains and losses related
  to land use and land management policies by taking into account the environmental
  and societal impacts of urban sprawl.
