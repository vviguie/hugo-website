# Foreword
Most of my papers deal with adaptation to climate change. I have also worked on several projects on mitigation policies in cities, and especially on how urban planning can play an important role on transport emission reductions (actually, both subjects are [deeply connected](https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1434)). I also sometimes worked on (almost) completely unrelated papers.

For all my peer-reviewed articles, there should be a freely available version on [HAL](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/vincent-viguie?langChosen=fr) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iElc2G8AAAAJ&hl), either pre-print or post-print. But if you want the publisher version and do not have the access, [send me an email](mailto:viguie.cired@gmail.com).
